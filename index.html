            <h4 class="down">-Sameera S Vasista-</h4>
            <p>Anyone who has decided to embark on a weight-loss expedition should know that it has to be hard so you’d never forget, but naturally, one would favor seeing results sooner and patients have a profound misinterpretation about dieting. We hate to break it to you, but just because you are trying to fit your favorite dress for a party next week, shedding a lot of weight headlong is quite an improbable task. It is also imperative to understand that large weight losses are uncustomary and depend on each individual’s lifestyle. But there is, in fact, a wrong notion amongst the masses, burn more calories than you consume and you’ll lose weight, it is just fair to say that there are more romantics than realists in its corner.

            <p>Let's look at what haunts people the most. Maybe one’s perturbed about their double chin and would want to get rid of it, but we have some unpleasant news: you just can’t. You can lose your overall weight by consuming the right food along with some exercise but the reality is that you can’t tell where the fat is shedding from. Not to forget, Solutions can sometimes be found if you put the non-negotiables first and try working around them. It seems fairly clear that dieting demands harsh rules and you’d need to subject your body to intense oppression which is always not empirical and set dieters up for a debacle. Adding to this, our body fights against a strict diet by slowing down metabolism and increases severe cravings which ultimately leads to binge eating and feeling of guilt. Irony is one such thing that can never be categorized as a cliche. Even to this day, people argue that you stop eating and you lose weight. The majority of the population fail to realize when they lose weight, they lose muscle along with fat.

            <p>We have heard a lot of people say Fitness and weight are like two sides of the same coin, you lose weight, you stay fit. But it is nothing but a myth. If you want to walk a block without losing your breath, it is not much about your weight, that’s really about your fitness. If your motive is to stay fit, one must learn to separate that from weight loss before making many changes towards their physical activity. 
            </p>
            <p>As the old saying goes, the quicker you lose weight, the quicker you gain it back, you may quickly lose your water weight, but that can easily come back on. True weight loss is rigorous and different for everybody, and every day is another chance to change your life.
